VERY SPECIFIC FILTERING RULES WITH DETAILED EXAMPLES:

üö® CRITICAL: If event type is "Vacation", ONLY include these arenas: madison-square-garden, barclays-center, yankee-stadium. NEVER exclude sports arenas for vacation events.

1. BIRTHDAY PARTY + SPORTS ARENA:
   ‚úÖ INCLUDE: madison-square-garden, barclays-center, yankee-stadium
   ‚ùå EXCLUDE: None - all sports arenas are suitable for birthday parties
   üìù EXAMPLE: Birthday party at sports arena - needs premium venue with sports atmosphere, suite experiences, group packages

2. SPORTING EVENTS + SPORTS ARENA:
   ‚úÖ INCLUDE: madison-square-garden, barclays-center, yankee-stadium
   ‚ùå EXCLUDE: None - all sports arenas are perfect for sporting events
   üìù EXAMPLE: Sporting event at arena - needs authentic sports venue, premium seating, group packages

3. CORPORATE EVENTS + SPORTS ARENA:
   ‚úÖ INCLUDE: madison-square-garden, barclays-center, yankee-stadium
   ‚ùå EXCLUDE: None - all sports arenas are suitable for corporate events

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. Return ONLY the JSON array, no other text. Start with [ and end with ].
2. Use the EXACT event type "${request.eventType}" in your reasoning
3. Follow the filtering rules EXACTLY - only include arenas from the INCLUDE lists
4. NEVER exclude sports arenas - they are all suitable for sports arena events
5. For all event types, prioritize premium experiences and suite packages
6. For large groups (50+ guests), emphasize group packages and premium amenities
7. For smaller groups (20-50 guests), focus on suite experiences and intimate settings

- Birthday Party + Sports Arena: "Perfect for Birthday Party sports experience" (Madison Square Garden), "Perfect for Birthday Party premium venue" (Barclays Center)
- Sporting Events + Sports Arena: "Perfect for Sporting Events authentic experience" (Madison Square Garden), "Perfect for Sporting Events basketball venue" (Barclays Center)
