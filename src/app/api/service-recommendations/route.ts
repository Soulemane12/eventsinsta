CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

3. Follow the filtering rules EXACTLY - only include services from the INCLUDE lists
4. NEVER include services from the EXCLUDE lists
5. For SPORTS ARENA venues, PRIORITIZE sports services (sports-knicks-birthday, sports-knicks-jersey-signing, boxing-lessons-eric-kelly, golf-lessons-access) and put them FIRST in the array
6. For Birthday Party + Sports Arena, focus on SPORTS ACTIVITIES, not party decorations or exotic cars
7. For Madison Square Garden, emphasize the iconic venue experience
8. For restaurants, include exotic cars and makeup services
9. For weddings, include all wedding-related services
10. For baby showers, keep it gentle and family-friendly
11. For vacation events, focus on entertainment and experiences, not birthday-specific services
12. NEVER use "Birthday Party" in reasoning when event type is "Vacation" - use "Vacation" instead

- Birthday Party + Restaurant: "Perfect for Birthday Party entertainment" (DJ), "Perfect for Birthday Party transportation" (exotic cars), "Perfect for Birthday Party beauty services" (makeup)
- Birthday Party + Sports Arena: "Perfect for Birthday Party sports experience" (NY Knicks), "Perfect for Birthday Party entertainment" (DJ), "Perfect for Birthday Party photography" (action shots)
