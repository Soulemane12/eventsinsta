# AI-Powered Restaurant Recommendation System

## Overview
I've implemented an intelligent AI recommendation system using Groq AI that analyzes user preferences and intelligently selects the best restaurants from the available options. The system shows only the most relevant restaurants with AI-powered reasoning.

## ü§ñ AI Features

### Smart Restaurant Selection
- **Intelligent Filtering**: AI analyzes event type, guest count, budget, and special requirements
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each recommendation comes with a confidence score (0-100%)
- **Personalized Reasoning**: AI explains why each restaurant is perfect for your event
- **Best Package Identification**: AI suggests the most suitable dining package

### User Experience
- **Minimal Initial Display**: Shows only essential info until user clicks for details
- **Expandable Cards**: Click "View Details" to see full restaurant information
- **AI Badge System**: Visual indicators for Perfect Match (90%+), Great Match (70%+), Good Match
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading animations while AI analyzes preferences

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### AI Service (`src/services/aiRecommendations.ts`)
```typescript
interface UserPreferences {
  eventType: string
  guestCount: number
  budget: string

  atmosphere?: string
  specialRequirements?: string[]
}

interface AIRecommendation {
  restaurantId: string
  confidence: number
  reasoning: string
  bestPackage: string
  whyPerfect: string
}
```

### AI Restaurant Card (`src/components/AIRestaurantCard.tsx`)
- **Compact View**: Shows restaurant name, cuisine, location, AI confidence, and best package
- **Expanded View**: Full details including AI reasoning, packages, features, and contact info
