# AI Restaurant Recommendation System

## Overview
I've integrated Groq AI to create an intelligent restaurant recommendation system that analyzes user event requirements and suggests the perfect restaurants from the three available options.

## ü§ñ AI Features

### Smart Matching
- **Event Type Analysis**: AI understands different event types (Anniversary, Birthday, Holiday Party, etc.)
- **Guest Count Optimization**: Matches restaurants based on capacity requirements
- **Budget Intelligence**: Suggests restaurants within the user's budget range
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides match confidence percentages (0-100%)

### AI-Powered Recommendations
Each recommendation includes:
- **Confidence Score**: How well the restaurant matches (Perfect/Good/Fair)
- **Reasoning**: AI explanation of why this restaurant is recommended
- **Best Package**: Specific package that fits the event
- **Why Perfect**: Detailed explanation of the match

## üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Integration

### Available Restaurants
1. **Saint Restaurant Bar & Speakeasy** - Contemporary American
2. **Reb√®l Restaurant & Bar** - Haitian & Caribbean Cuisine  
3. **Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House** - American Steakhouse

### AI Matching Examples
